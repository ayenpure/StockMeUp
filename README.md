This is the repository created for the class project for 'CIS 610 : Data Science'<br>

My main objective doing this project is to demonstrate skills to use various concepts learnt in the class, which includes Data Mining and Analysis.
I am trying to implement a tool that helps validate stock market recommendations from a certain source. At present the whole world is dealing with a biased, fake media crysis and it is very hard to tell which information is true and which is false, and hence relying on a single source of information can be a disaster.

Usually to make a decision related to stock markets it is very necessary to check with multiple sources for the getting a trend for a certain stock.
I am trying to automate the process by using the concepts of data mining, sentiment analysis, and data analysis using Map Reduce.
